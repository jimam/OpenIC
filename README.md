OpenIC
======

An Open Information Center.
This project repo for the PA Consultancy Raspberry Pi competition.

This project includes a webserver using flask for viewing and downloading information.
It works best when set up in a reverse proxy with something like nginx.

It comes with a web interface for adding infomation, viewing information and managing how and where the infomation is sent to.
OpenIC also comes with an API so that you could write a mobile app to communicate with it.
