Our project is called OpenIC, Open Information Centre.
We realise that our submission doesn't quite meet the specification of the competition, but we wanted to send it in anyway.
OpenIC is run on a Raspberry Pi which acts as a server for OpenIC.
OpenIC is a way of asking questions to people in specified groups. It can also be used a way to ask about information from people in groups. Say I forget my Maths homework task, I can post a question or topic to my Maths homework group. From there it can be answered  by anybody who's  a part of the group.
OpenIC runs well on the Raspberry Pi, due to its environmentally friendly low power usage, which makes it ideal for a server. OpenIC contains a web client by default, powered by Flask and is accessible from your local browser or anywhere in the world once setup. It also has a (work in progress) API, that will in the future allow for mobile applications to connect to OpenIC.
Perhaps I'm on my way home and want to ask my family if they need anything from the shops, I can send out a question from my phone to the family group. They can then respond with their mobile devices in real time and discuss their answers together.

We are still working on the server functionality, so as a result the mobile applications aren't working yet.
We know our project isn't really what you're looking for, but we hope you enjoyed hearing about it.
